# üè° DreamStay Booking App Project

## üìå Overview

This is a full-stack booking application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The app allows users to register, log in, book available listings, listing houses and browse listings based on availability.
The key features of the app include:

- User registration and login
- Booking and listing management
- Browsing available listings with filters

## üöÄ Tools & Frameworks

This project leverages the following tools and frameworks:

- **Frontend**:

  - React (created using Vite for optimized builds)
  - React Router for client-side navigation
  - Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first design

- **Backend**:

  - Node.js and Express for the server
  - MongoDB for the database
  - Mongoose for handling MongoDB connections and models

- **Other Tools**:
  - GitHub for version control
  - Trello for project management and task tracking

## üí° Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Xhz0729/my-booking-app-repository.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the client folder and install the required dependencies:

Go to client and install dependencies:

```
  cd client
  npm install
```

Go to server and install dependencies:

```
  cd ..
  cd server
  npm install
```

### 3. MongoDB Setup

#### Step 1: Create a MongoDB Cluster

- Go to the [MongoDB Atlas website](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
- Create an account (if you don‚Äôt have one already) or log in.
- Once logged in, create a new **Cluster** by following the instructions. Choose a free tier if you're setting up a development environment.

#### Step 2: Get the MongoDB Connection URL

- After the cluster is created, click **Connect** and choose **Connect your application**.
- Select **Node.js** as your driver and ensure the version is compatible.
- Copy the provided connection string (this is your `MONGO_URL`).
  - The connection string should look something like this:
    ```
    mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```
- Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the credentials you set up during the MongoDB cluster creation.

- **Note:** The data schema for your application is located in the `server/models` folder, and MongoDB will automatically create the necessary collections based on those models when you interact with the database.

#### Step 3: Create a `.env` File in the Server Directory

- In the `server` folder of your project, create a `.env` file.
- Add the MongoDB connection URL you copied in Step 2 to the `.env` file like this:

  ```env
  MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/dreamStayDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  ```

- Also, add other environment variables such as the port and JWT secret:
  ```env
  MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
  ```

#### Step 4: Connect the App to MongoDB

- Ensure that your backend server is correctly connected to MongoDB by starting it with:
  ```bash
  cd server
  npm run dev
  ```

## üåê Setting Up AWS S3 for Image Storage

#### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

- Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
- Navigate to S3 and click Create bucket named dream-stay-booking-app
- Name your bucket and choose a region.
- Enable public access settings to allow images to be publicly accessible.
- Save your bucket settings.

#### Step 2: Configure AWS IAM Permissions

- Go to IAM in the AWS Console and create a user with programmatic access.
- Attach the AmazonS3FullAccess policy to this user.
- Save your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key in the .env file you created in the server

```
  S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
  S3_SECRET_ACCESS=your_secret_access_key

```

## üó∫Ô∏è Getting a Google Maps API Key

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://developers.google.com/maps)

- Create a new project, or select an existing one.

- Navigate to APIs & Services > Library, search for Maps JavaScript API, and enable it.

- Go to Credentials and click Create Credentials > API Key.

- Copy the generated API key and add it to both the client and server .env file:

- For client side

```
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = your_google_maps_api_key

```

- For server side

```
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = your_google_maps_api_key

```

## üéØ Advanced Feature to Improve

#### User Search by Location

In a real-world scenario, users may want to book accommodations in a specific location. This feature will enable users to filter listings by destination, narrowing results to match their desired location for a more streamlined experience.

#### User Search by Max Guests Available

Adding a "Max Guests Available" filter allows users to search for accommodations that can accommodate a specific number of guests. This feature is especially helpful for groups or families who want to ensure that their selected property has enough capacity, making searches faster and more relevant.

#### Payment Feature Integration

The booking functionality currently allows for reservations, but integrating a payment feature will enable users to complete their booking with secure online payments directly on the platform. This feature will enhance the user experience by streamlining the process, making it possible to confirm and pay within the app.

#### Guest Number Capacity Check

While each accommodation has a set maximum guest capacity, this value isn‚Äôt currently enforced during booking. This feature will verify that the number of guests entered by users does not exceed the property‚Äôs capacity, ensuring a more accurate booking experience and preventing overbookings.

## Project Management

The development of this project is tracked using a [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/670feb7f0c9ba7d89c54cb48/ATTI7a52d3b4a19fbdafec91207eacbcbe8bE2C939D1/dream-stay-app). You can follow the progress, view tasks, and check completed milestones on the board.
